Used Speech Recognition Module 
Used Selenium
Used PyautoGui

Let say you have been stuck with a word that you dont know ! Instead of copying it and searching it again , you could just keep this script running and just copy the text and 
speak "SEARCH" and it searches automatically for you! 

It can be performed multiple time no restrictions ;)

Automating makes tasks complete within seconds and makes it easy!!

Dont forget to say stop after completion XDXD
